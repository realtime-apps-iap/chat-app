-   Display usernames of all users in the room
-   Notifications when a user enter / leaves the room
-   Profanity filter - users cannot send messages containing profanity

## Deployment

A [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) account and the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) is needed to deploy this application to Heroku. Docker is also required.

Log in to container registry
```console
$ heroku container:login
```

If you want to create a new Heroku app to deploy to, navigate to the appâ€™s directory and create a Heroku app:
```console
$ heroku create
```

Alternatively, if there is already a Heroku app you want to add this to, add the remote to the repository:
```console
$ heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
```

Build the image and push to Container Registry:
```console
$ heroku container:push web
```

Then release the image to your app:
```console
$ heroku container:release web
```
